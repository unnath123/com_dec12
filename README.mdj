A compressor/decompressor is a application that compresses and decompresses a data object or file. It enables the compression of data or files and the subsequent reversal of the compressed data to its original state.
In the present system, there are so many problems while transferring or sharing a file of large size. These files cannot be sent over a network if they are above certain size limits. Even if the size of the file is small but if the internet connection speed is slow, then too it is difficult to send them. These limitations create a lot of problems when we need to share an urgent file and we just can’t due to the size limit of the file. Therefore, there is a need to build a system that can compress and decompress the files easily so they can be shared efficiently without any constraint.
Some important reasons for developing this project are:
The intention of file compression is to significantly reduce the space to store a file and transmit it
File compression also increases data transfer speed. It is obvious that the longer file would take more time to be transferred and there is a maximum possibility of interruption between the file transfer process
File Compression also provides file security by hiding information. This is useful when we do not want information to be available to the public. This can be done by compressing a file that can’t be decompressed by a commonly used computer software.
The project “Data Compression and Decompression” System is totally built on Java technology and provides an interface to the users so that they can easily store and transfer large files. This java project also provides encoding techniques in compression so as to ensure the security of the data. Using this project, the users can compress the data according to the requirement at any point and for any number of times.
